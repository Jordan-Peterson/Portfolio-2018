# CS455-HW2-PC

## _Description_
This project is a scalable server that uses a thread pool to manage and load balance active network connections. This server can have any number of client connected to it and still process their requests.

### Class Breakdown

- Client
    - Client.java - Creates a connection to the server and sends N randomly generated byte[] every second. Receives hashes of the byte[] sent to the server and checks the hashes in a linked list.

    - List.java - Creates a linked list that checks if the hash received has been sent before.

    - StatisticsThread.java - Creates a thread that gathers statistics about throughput.

- Server

    - Server.java - Creates a server that sets up connections to clients, receives byte[]s from clients and makes worker threads calculate hashes, sends hashes to clients.

    - TaskManager.java - Creates a thread pool manager that assigns tasks to worker threads.

    - TaskExecutor.java - Checks to see if worker threads are finished and sends results to the server to be sent to the clients.

    - WorkerThread.java - Thread that hashes a byte[]

    - Task.java - An object that stores a byte[], SelectionKey and the resulting hash.

    - StatisticsThread.java - Logs the statistics of the server throughput, clients connected, mean per-client throughput, and std. deviation of per-client throughput
