# Purpose

This project is a personal package for performing information security mathematical formulas. The Functionalities include:

* GCD(a,b) : -g <a,b> Used to find the gcd between to numbers using the euclidian algorithm
                    @Returns: single integer value of greatest common divisor of a,b

* Extended Euclidian Algorithm(a,p) : -e <a,p> Used to find the inverse of 'a' with respect to prime number 'p'.


### Language:

* Python
