1. Client
---------


    1.1 Introduction
    
The client is the user's only view into the IRC. Though the client, 
the user must register themselves by providing a nickname and a password
to identify the user. The client has a sending and receiving thread in order
to mitigate collisions when reading from the server and writing to the server.

After the user registers/logs into the IRC, they have access to create, join, and leave
chat rooms. The user can be a part of many chat rooms and also private message others online.


    1.2 Initiation

When the client starts up, it reads through the configuation file "chatclient.conf".
From this file the client knows the last server that it connected to and what
port it was connected to as well. The client is also populated with options 
for debuging and logging. If the config file sets logging, then the client will
log everything that the user types to the server. After the bookkeeping is over
the client will try to connect to the server and initiate the chatroom experience.


2. Server
---------


    2.1 Introduction

The server is the linch-pin of the chat room. It organizes the clients and
provides services based off of commands that the user passes to the server.
Along with providing user connectivity information, the server allows the 
users to be unique as each one will have a their own nickname to identify them.
The server has the responsibility to log and document the current users and channels
in case of a sudden shutdown. This is handled in the initiation.


    2.2 Initiation

When the server shutsdown, it needs to keep a memory of the final state of the server.
It accomplishes this through a few log files that it alters in real time as the 
state of the chat rooms and users evolve.

Similar to the client, the server also has a configuration file "chatserver.conf" which leads
the server in setting up the sever socket with an ip address and a couple ports to use.

Also similar to the client, the server is multitheaded to handle many clients at once.
